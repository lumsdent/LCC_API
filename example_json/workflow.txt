An Admin creates a list of team names
    teams:[
    {
        id: 1,
        name:teamA,
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name:teamB,
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        name:teamC,
    }
    ]

An Admin can also create a list of seasons 

    seasons:[
        {id: 1,
        "type": "Regular",
        name: "LCC Season 1"},
        {id: 1T,
        "type": "Tie-breaker",
        name: "LCC Season 1 Tiebreakers"},
        {id: 1P,
        "type": "Playoff"
        name: "LCC Season 1 Playoffs"}
    ]

An Admin can add teams to a season (tracked on the team rosters)
    {
        id: 1,
        name:teamA,
        rosters:[
            {
                1: {
                    
                    }
            } 
        ]
         }

That player gets drafted to a team and the Admin assigns the registered player to their position and team for a particular season
    Ex. TopDiff is the new toplaner for teamA for season.id 1 

    we need to add a roster for the teamA
        {
        id: 1,
        name:teamA,
        rosters:[
            {
                1: {
                    "TOP": "c2xoTJ33QjBVjNX4U2IzxcvMwd9keVQE0M0AcoJfh9l_82XMZSo07zyjg87RmWV-KjnlXqMzqcFm-A" 
                    }
            } //puuid for TopDiff
        ]
         }

    we need to add a team to topdiff player obj

    {
    "profile": {
        "puuid": "c2xoTJ33QjBVjNX4U2IzxcvMwd9keVQE0M0AcoJfh9l_82XMZSo07zyjg87RmWV-KjnlXqMzqcFm-A",
        "name": "TopDiff",
        "tag": "NA",
        "level": 30,
        "email": "topdiff@gmail.com",
        "bio": "I'm a top laner who loves to play tanks and bruisers.",
        "primaryRole": "Top",
        "secondaryRole": "Jungle",
        "images": {
          "icon": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.20.1/img/profileicon/505.png",
          "banner": "https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/TahmKench_0.jpg"
        }
      },
      teams: [{1:"teamA"}]
    }

THE HARD PART
The player plays champA in a match against teamB playing ChampB.
The Admin adds the match ID, the team names, and the season (or selects a match in a season)

    Add the match data to the database containing all 10 players in the game
    for each player in game, find their matchup and add their matchup to their player data (10 iteration)
        TopDiff champA vs OtherGuy champB on TopDiffs player data
        OtherGuy champB vs TopDiff champA on OtherGuys player data

        Check if the player has stats on champA
        if not, insert champion stats for champA
        if so, retrieve TopDiffs championStats for ChampA and add the new match to them.
        update TopDiffs aggregateStats with the new match

The Admin can upload a vod link with the match ID
